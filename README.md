# Bollinger Bands Filled ReadMe

## Description

This code is an indicator for the Bollinger Bands Filled. The Bollinger Bands are a popular technical analysis tool that consists of a moving average line in the middle, and two standard deviation lines (upper and lower bands) above and below the moving average. The Bollinger Bands Filled indicator plots the area between the upper and lower bands as a filled color on the chart.

This indicator helps traders identify periods of high and low volatility in the market. When the price is in the filled area, it suggests that the market is ranging or consolidating. When the price moves outside the filled area, it indicates potential breakout opportunities.

## Input Parameters

- `Period`: The period of the Bollinger Bands (default: 20)
- `Deviation`: The standard deviation multiplier (default: 2.0)
- `FillColor`: The fill color for the indicator (default: clrDodgerBlue)
- `Transparent`: Enable transparency for the fill color (default: true)
- `Background`: The background color of the chart (default: clrWhite)

## Initialization

In the initialization function (`OnInit()`), the indicator buffers are set using the `SetIndexBuffer()` function. The upper and lower bands are stored in separate arrays (`UpperBand[]` and `LowerBand[]`). The indicator label is set using the `IndicatorSetString()` function.

The chart properties are also set in the initialization function. If the `Transparent` input parameter is set to true, the background color of the chart is set to the `Background` color.

## Calculation

In the calculation function (`OnCalculate()`), the Bollinger Bands are calculated using a loop. The loop starts from the `bufferShift` value and calculates the moving average and standard deviation for each period. The upper and lower bands are then calculated using the moving average and standard deviation.

The `IsStopped()` function is used to check if the indicator calculation should be stopped.
